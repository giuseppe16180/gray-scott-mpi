# GRAY SCOTT MPI

Implementation of Gray-Scott Model of a Reaction-Diffusion System, using Message Passing Interface (MPI) in Python.

The project includes several experiments, if you only care about the model, check out the files `gray-scott-mpi.py` and `gray-scott.py`. 

If you want to run the MPI version you need to be able of running something like `mpirun -n 8 python gray-scott-mpi.py 1000`. You can get more details reading the MPI4PY docs [here](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Note: you should include the [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) folder in the root in order to correctly visualize the content included in `slides.html`, where you can find a complete explanation of the project, with the discussion about all of the experiments.
